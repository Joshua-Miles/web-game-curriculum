# Module 2: Code Organization & Metaprogramming

- Lesson VI: 
  - Concept: Composition vs Inheritance
  - Tools:
    - Factory Functions
    - The "spread" operator
  - Application: Multiple enemy types composed of an "Attacker" behavior set
- Lesson VII:
  - Concept: Modular Code
  - Tools
    - Webpack
  - Application: An ES6 Module-based dependency system
- Lesson VIII:
  - Concept: Meta Programming with Object Prototype Manipulation
  - Tools:
    - The Class's "prototype" property
    - The "rest" operator
  - Application: A Class definition for our "Attacker" behavior set and higher order enemy types
- Lesson IX:
  - Concept: Domain Specific Languages
  - Tools:
    - Currying
    - Closures
  - Application: A track scripting language to make our enemies move
- Lesson X:
  - Concept: Babel and Decorators
  - Tools: 
    - Decorators
    - Babel
  - Application: Decorators to beautify our higher order Enemy types
- Projects: 
  - Using the tools we've built, create a system with at least 6 behavior sets and 3 types composed of those behavior sets. Each Type should have unique interactions with the moveable character
  - Using the HUD you built in Module 1 and the DSL techniques you learned in this module, create a domain specific language to easily describe a conversation that a character might have with the moveable character, allowing the HUD to render the relevant dialog, and accept input from the user to drive the course of the conversation.
