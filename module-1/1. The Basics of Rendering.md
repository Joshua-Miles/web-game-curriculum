## Lesson

Most user-facing software applications have what is commonly referred to as a "Rendering Layer".

A rendering layer is a method by which a developer's code tells a computer what to display on the screen of a user's monitor. Take the screen you're viewing now as an example:

* First, some much lower-level code turned a bunch of 1's and 0's into a piece of text, commonly referred to in computing as a "string". 
* Then, that string was annotated as a paragraph (as opposed to header, or an image) and handed off to a **rendering layer**, which used your computer's native drivers to render the words you are now reading.

In the web, the browser serves as the rendering layer, which uses a language named **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language) to design visual elements within the browser window. 

You can start playing with the browser as a rendering layer right now. Create a file on your computer named `index.html`. Then, open it in a text editor like notepad (not a rich text editor like Microsoft Word), and paste the following content into the file:

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>
            Hello World
        </h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

After you are done pasting, click the file (it should open in your default browser) and you should see a nice, big, ugly page header that reads "Hello World".

Change the word "World" in the file to your name, then refresh your browser window. See how that word changes verbatim? That's because it is between the opening and closing **tag**s of an html **element** called an `h1 tag`. See how the other words in the file are enclosed by angle brackets? Between the angle brackets is the markup of Hypertext Markup Language. The "h1" tells the browser that the text which comes next should be a top-level heading. See the forward slash before the next "h1"? That tells the browser that the heading has finished. Add some random text  between the  `</h1>` and `</body>` lines. 

See how it looks different? It is not considered by the browser to be a top-level heading because it is not inside of an h1 tag. Now change both instances of `h1` to `h3`. See how the text becomes smaller? `h3` is another tag name, which tells the browser that the contained text should be treated as sub-heading.

`h1` and `h3` are **tag names**. There are many tag names besides `h1` and `h3`, I recommend you read about them here: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp

Of course, a finite list of tags cannot, in and of themselves define *all* of the *many* visual elements we might want to display on a screen. That is why we have **attributes** and **CSS** (Cascading Stylesheets). 

Attributes are key-value pairs added to tags like so: `<h1 class="my-header"></h1>`. The word "class" is the key, more commonly referred to as the name of the attribute, and "my-header" is the value of the attribute.  While all html elements accept many of the same attributes (they can all have a class attribute, for example), html elements can also accept attributes specific to the element. 

Take the `img` tag, for example. Replace the contents of your `index.html` file with the following: 

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <img class="character" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joshua-Miles/web-game-curriculum/master/module-1/assets/green-character/static.gif"></img>
    </body>
</html>
```

When you refresh the page, you should see an image of a small character appear on your screen, because "img" is short for "image" tag, the src attribute defines an address where the browser can find an image to render.

The other attribute on our img tag, named "class", is used for selecting elements- categorizing elements so that we can reference them elsewhere in our code. We don't reference html elements from within HTML, but we do reference them in CSS- another language, which is used to give us a little more control over how visual elements appear on the screen. Add the following to your `index.html` file, just above the `<body>` tag:

```html
<head>
    <style>
        .character {
            position: absolute;
            left: 100px;
            bottom: 100px;
            width: 75px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
```



Inside of the `<style>` tag is CSS code. It involves a selector `.character`, which tells the browser to find all of the elements where the `class` attribute has a value of character (the "." tells the browser that it's searching based on class, you can search based on other attributes as well). The curly braces which come afterwards wrap all of the styling rules which the browser should apply to the elements which match the given selector. The first one, `position: absolute;`, tells the browser that we want to position the element manually. The second, `left: 100px;`, tells the browser to add 100 pixels of whitespace to the left of the character- or, in other words, move the character 100 pixels to the right. Finally, `width: 100px` tells the browser to make the image 100 pixels wide. 

There are more ways to select html elements in CSS, as well as more styling rules than I can shake a stick at, so I would recommend referencing those here: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp

Lastly, it is important to note that everything we have rendered so far is static- it can't respond to user interaction. We will use **JavaScript** to add interactivity to the app we have begun to build. Add the following to your code, just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script>
    let characterElement = document.querySelector('.character')

    characterElement.addEventListener('click', function(){
        characterElement.remove()
    })
</script>
```

Inside the `<script> ` tag we can write JavaScript code. As opposed to HTML and CSS, JavaScript a **Turing Complete Language**- this has a very specific and  technical meaning, but for our purposes today, it simply means that you can do more with it than you  can with HTML and CSS on their own.

The first line of the JavaScript we've added to our app uses the same selector as our css- '.character'- to select the image element from the HTML document. It uses the keyword `let` to assign that element to the name "characterElement".  

We will cover what happens on the next few lines in greater detail during the next lesson, but hopefully you already have idea of what it might do: here we tell the browser that when the image is clicked, it should be removed from the page. 

Before we move on, let's do some re-organizing. Right now, we are using HTML for some logic (creating an image on the page), CSS for some logic (placing and sizing that image) and JavaScript for some logic (removing the image when it is clicked). To keep our code more manageable, we're going to move all of this logic into the JavaScript portion of our code. 

What this basically means, is that we will be using JavaScript to write the HTML and CSS for us, so that we can do it programmatically.

Change the first line of your JavaScript to the following: 

```javascript
let characterElement = document.createElement('img')
```

Instead of finding an existing HTML element, this creates a brand new element. We want to give this image the same `.src` attribute, so we will add it to the element on the next line like so:

```javascript
let assets = 'https://joshua-miles.github.io/web-game-curriculum/module-1/assets/green-character'
characterElement.src = `${assets}/static.gif`
```

Notice the syntax here- `characterElement` still refers to our html tag, we've used a "." to set an attribute of the element, named "src", to the same value we used in our HTML. We used double quotes around the address to the image because we want the computed to take that verbatim- quotes create a "string", which is a piece of literal text, as we covered at the beginning of our lesson.

We can add our CSS styling as attributes as well:

```javascript
characterElement.style.position = 'absolute'
characterElement.style.left = '200px'
characterElement.style.bottom = '200px'
characterElement.style.width = '75px'
```

The `.style` tells the browser we want to add CSS or "style" rules, "position", "left", "bottom" and "width" each target a specific style attribute, and using the JavaScript assignment operator "=", we give each style attribute a value as a string.

Finally, we need to tell the browser where to put the element on the page:

```javascript
document.body.append(characterElement)
```

The "document" represents everything in the browser window, often referred to as the page.  We are targeting the body tag in inside the HTML document, and adding the image we have created with JavaScript to it. If you refresh your browser, you should now see two identical characters next to each other.

If you open your dev tools (this is accomplished in most browsers by right clicking the page and selecting "inspect" from the dropdown menu), you should see your html structure in a side panel. Notice how there are now two image tags- the first you created by hand in your HTML file, the second was created in your JavaScript. Delete the image from your HTML, and delete the Style and Head tags as well.

 We won't need them moving forward into our next lesson, as we try to make the image we have created with JavaScript moveable.



## Finished Code

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<html>
    <body>
        <script>
        	let characterElement = document.createElement('img')
            let assets = 'https://joshua-miles.github.io/web-game-curriculum/module-1/assets/green-character'
            characterElement.src = `${assets}/static.gif`
            characterElement.style.position = 'absolute'
			characterElement.style.left = '200px'
            characterElement.style.bottom = '200px'
			characterElement.style.width = '75px'
            document.body.append(characterElement)
            
            characterElement.addEventListener('click', function(){
                characterElement.remove()
            })
        </script>
    </body>
</html>

```

* Try to render the image a little lower on the page. What style attribute could we set to move it down? Use the CSS reference as a guide.
* We can also render videos using HTML tags- try to render the video found at this address: https://youtu.be/0ZNIQOO2sfA
  * Use the HTML reference as a guide
  * Create the element using HTML first
  * Try to create the element and add it to the page using JavaScript
