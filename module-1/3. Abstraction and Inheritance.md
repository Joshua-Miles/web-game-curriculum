# Abstraction and Inheritance

## Outline

* Creating objects to group our characters data and behavior together
* Using a class to make our code more extendible
* Using inheritance to create "sub types" of objects

## Lesson

The logic for our moveable character is pretty cool, but so far it has a pretty serious flaw: we can't reuse it. In programming, writing code which is reusable is hugely important for building long lasting applications. 

Try calling `createCharacter` from your console:

```javascript
let mySecondCharacter = createCharacter()
```

If you inspect your elements panel in the developer console, you'll see that we have, in fact, created two characters- they are right on top of each other, but they are both there. However, if you use the arrow keys, or if you call one of our movement functions (`walkLeft`), only one of the characters will move- that is because all of the **behavior**, a word which here refers to our functions related to the movement of the character, was written specifically for `myCharacter`, not `mySecondCharacter`.

Right now, if we wanted a second character, we would need to duplicate almost all of our code- because our code assumes that we will only ever have one character. We want to be able to create other characters, as well as other game objects, while writing as little code as possible.

To do this, we are going to group the logic that defines how a character or game object should behave into **objects**. An object is a type of variable, like strings, numbers, or booleans. Unlike strings, numbers, and booleans, objects act as containers for other variables. Let's create an object at the end of our `createCharacter` function:

```javascript
let createCharacter = function(){
	let characterElement = document.createElement('img')
    characterElement.src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/triframe/image/upload/v1548570880/Game-Track/Assets/static.gif'
    characterElement.style.position = 'absolute'
    characterElement.style.left = '200px'
    characterElement.style.bottom = '200px'
    characterElement.style.width = '75px'
    document.body.append(characterElement)
	let character = {}
}
```

The curly braces tell JavaScript to create a new, empty object. Our object can contain **properties**, variables specific to that object, and we can add them two ways. Let's add a property which references the image that represents our character, first by adding it after the object is created:

```javascript
let createCharacter = function(){
	...
    let character = {}
    character.element = characterElement
    character.direction = false
    return character
}
```

Then by adding it as we create the object:

```javascript
let createCharacter = function(){
	...
    let character = {
        element: characterElement,
        direction: false
    }
    return character
}
```

Sometimes you will want to add properties to an object after it's created, but when we can, it always nice to add them when an object is created. Notice, that when we add more than one property while creating an object, we  separate the properties by commas. Properties of an object can also be functions, and when a function serves as the property of an object we call it a **method**. Let's add our movement methods as properties of the character object:

```javascript
let createCharacter = function(){
	...
    let character = {
        element: characterElement,
        walkRight(){
              character.element.src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/triframe/image/upload/v1548570880/Game-Track/Assets/walkright.gif'
              character.direction = 'right'
          },

        walkLeft(){
            character.element.src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/triframe/image/upload/v1548570880/Game-Track/Assets/walkleft.gif'
            character.direction = 'left'
        },

        walkUp(){
            character.element.src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/triframe/image/upload/v1548570880/Game-Track/Assets/walkup.gif'
            character.direction = 'up'
        },

        walkDown(){
            character.element.src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/triframe/image/upload/v1548570880/Game-Track/Assets/walkdown.gif'
            character.direction = 'down'
        },


        stop(){
            character.element.src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/triframe/image/upload/v1548570880/Game-Track/Assets/static.gif'
            character.direction = false
        }
	}
    return character
}
```

Notice a few things here:

* We no longer use the `function` keyword when defining object methods
* We don't use colons either
* We replaced `characterElement` and `direction` with `character.element` and `character.direction`- We use `<object name>.<property name>` to reference object properties both outside of objects and inside of object methods.

You may need to comment out your `setInterval` code, but run this in your browser, and call `createCharacter` in your console:

```javascript
let character = createCharacter()
```

Now type `character` and press enter. You should be able to expand the character object and see it's properties. Now call `character.walkLeft()`. Then check the value of `character.direction` It's value should have changed to "left".  If you create a second character, you can change it's direction independently of the first characters direction. Neat!

We need to have a `setInterval` running to actually move the character, and we need to connect the keyboard event listeners that we wrote in the last lesson. But first, we are going to refactor our `createCharacter` function into a `Character` **class**.

Now that you have seen that function can create and return an object, we will use a syntax which makes writing these types of functions easier. Classes are, under the hood, functions which create objects. We can also think of them as "object templates" that we can reuse. Here are some steps we will take to refactor our function into a class:

* Create the class:

  ```
  class Character {
      
  }
  ```

* Add the definition of any non-method properties into a **constructor** method:

  ```javascript
  class Character {
     constructor(){
          let characterElement = document.createElement('img')
          characterElement.src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/triframe/image/upload/v1548570880/Game-Track/Assets/static.gif'
          characterElement.style.position = 'absolute'
          characterElement.style.left = '200px'
          characterElement.style.bottom = '200px'
          characterElement.style.width = '75px'
          document.body.append(characterElement)
          
          character.element = characterElement
          character.direction = false
     } 
  }
  ```

* Add the methods outside of the constructor and remove the comma's:

  ```javascript
  class Character {
  
     constructor(){
          let characterElement = document.createElement('img')
          characterElement.src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/triframe/image/upload/v1548570880/Game-Track/Assets/static.gif'
          characterElement.style.position = 'absolute'
          characterElement.style.left = '200px'
          characterElement.style.bottom = '200px'
          characterElement.style.width = '75px'
          document.body.append(characterElement)
          
          character.element = characterElement
          character.direction = false
     } 
     
      walkRight(){
          character.element.src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/triframe/image/upload/v1548570880/Game-Track/Assets/walkright.gif'
          character.direction = 'right'
      }
  
      walkLeft(){
      character.element.src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/triframe/image/upload/v1548570880/Game-Track/Assets/walkleft.gif'
      character.direction = 'left'
      }
  
      walkUp(){
      character.element.src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/triframe/image/upload/v1548570880/Game-Track/Assets/walkup.gif'
      character.direction = 'up'
      }
  
      walkDown(){
      character.element.src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/triframe/image/upload/v1548570880/Game-Track/Assets/walkdown.gif'
      character.direction = 'down'
      }
  
  
      stop(){
      character.element.src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/triframe/image/upload/v1548570880/Game-Track/Assets/static.gif'
      character.direction = false
      }
  }
  ```

* Replace "character" with JavaScript's keyword "this":

  ```javascript
  class Character {
  
     constructor(){
          let characterElement = document.createElement('img')
          characterElement.src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/triframe/image/upload/v1548570880/Game-Track/Assets/static.gif'
          characterElement.style.position = 'absolute'
          characterElement.style.left = '200px'
          characterElement.style.bottom = '200px'
          characterElement.style.width = '75px'
          document.body.append(characterElement)
          
          this.element = characterElement
          this.direction = false
     } 
     
      walkRight(){
          this.element.src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/triframe/image/upload/v1548570880/Game-Track/Assets/walkright.gif'
          this.direction = 'right'
      }
  
      walkLeft(){
          this.element.src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/triframe/image/upload/v1548570880/Game-Track/Assets/walkleft.gif'
          character.direction = 'left'
      }
  
      walkUp(){
          this.element.src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/triframe/image/upload/v1548570880/Game-Track/Assets/walkup.gif'
          this.direction = 'up'
      }
  
      walkDown(){
          this.element.src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/triframe/image/upload/v1548570880/Game-Track/Assets/walkdown.gif'
          this.direction = 'down'
      }
  
  
      stop(){
          this.element.src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/triframe/image/upload/v1548570880/Game-Track/Assets/static.gif'
          this.direction = false
      }
  }
  ```



Now let's talk about the class we've created. Like the `createCharacter` function, the `Character` class tells JavaScript how to create an object- we would call these objects **instance**s of the Character class. The `this` keyword is used to refer to an instance  of the class from inside of the class. As you may guess, the `constructor` method is special- it is a method that will be invoked automatically when an instance of the Character class is created. We typically use it to create properties for the object, like element and direction. We could also use it to run our set interval logic as well:

```javascript
constructor(){
	...
	setInterval(function(){
        if(this.direction == 'right'){
        	this.element.style.left = parseInt(this.element.style.left) + 1 + 'px'
        } 
        if(this.direction == 'left'){
        	this.element.style.left = parseInt(this.element.style.left) - 1 + 'px'
        } 
        if(this.direction == 'up'){
        	this.element.style.bottom = parseInt(this.element.style.bottom) + 1 + 'px'
        } 
        if(this.direction == 'down'){
        	this.element.style.bottom = parseInt(this.element.style.bottom) - 1 + 'px'
    	} 
    }, 1)    
}
```

Now, every time we create a new instance of a Character, that character will consistently handle it's own movement by checking it's own direction every millisecond... in theory.

Replace `let myCharacter = createCharacter()` with `let character = new Character`. The `new` keyword creates a new instance of the Character class, creating a new object, and running the Character's constructor, replacing "this" with the object it has just created. Now refresh your browser and try running `character.walkLeft()` in you console- we would expect that the character would begin walking left, but instead, we should get an error, probably something about "cannot read property style of undefined". You may tempted to think that the computer is telling us that style is undefined. But that is *not* the case. It is telling us that it cannot read *property* style of undefined, meaning that somewhere in our code we wrote `<something>.style`, where `<something>` was undefined. If you follow the line number in the error, you will probably see that the line which throws the error is `this.element.style.left = ...` In this case, it is `this.element` which is undefined, and so it is when we try to call `style` on `undefined` that  an error is thrown. Just above that line, let's log "this": 

```javascript
 if(this.direction == 'left'){
 	console.log('This is:', this)
 	this.element.style.left = parseInt(this.element.style.left) + 1 + 'px'
 } 
```

Depending on your browser, you will either see that "this" is undefined, or, more likely the "window" object. In any event, it is very clearly *not* the instance of a character like we expected. That s because we are no longer inside of a Character method- we are inside of a callback function, passed to `setInterval` inside of a Character method! This is unfortunate, but fortunately easy to fix, we will change our callback function to be an **arrow function**, which will "bind" it's "this" value to the Character instance:

```javascript
setInterval( () => {
	...
})
```

Other than binding "this" differently, arrow functions will behave the same as normal functions, and are defined by an arrow (`=>`) on the right side of the function parenthesis as opposed to the `function` keyword on the left side of the function parenthesis.

Remove your console.log, and also update your keyboard event listeners to reference the `character`'s methods as opposed to the normal functions it is currently trying to reference:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e){
    if(character.direction) return
    if(e.key == 'ArrowRight'){
    	character.walkRight()
    }
    if(e.key == 'ArrowLeft'){
    	character.walkLeft()
    }
    if(e.key == 'ArrowUp'){
    	character.walkUp()
    }
    if(e.key == 'ArrowDown'){
    	character.walkDown()
    }
})

document.addEventListener('keyup', function(){
	character.stop()
})
```

Now our code should be working again! Only this time, our code is neatly organized and highly reusable- we should be able to create characters and make them walk around the screen independently of one another- note, however, that we are only moving one character in response to keyboard events.

This is good and all, but why would we realistically want 2 of the exact same character? We probably wouldn't.

We can accept variables into an object's `constructor` method, and pass them in when we instantiate a class with the `new` keyword, like this:

* In the constructor: 

```javascript
constructor(x, y){ // < WE RECEIVED VARIABLES HERE 
	let characterElement = document.createElement('img')
    characterElement.src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/triframe/image/upload/v1548570880/Game-Track/Assets/static.gif'
    characterElement.style.position = 'absolute'
    characterElement.style.left = x // < AND USED THEM HERE
    characterElement.style.bottom = y // < AND HERE
    characterElement.style.width = '75px'
    document.body.append(characterElement)
    this.element = characterElement
    this.direction = false
}
```

* When we instantiate:

```javascript
let character = new Character('200px', '200px')
```

Finally, we are going to make one more distinction in our code- some of the logic inside of our character class can be applied to every object in our game- walls, backgrounds, and items will all need to be represented by an image, and they will all need to be positioned absolutely. In other words, we may want to use some of the logic of our character class elsewhere- so it makes sense to separate it from our character logic, by making it a parent "type" called GameObject, the behavior of which our Character class will still have via **inheritance**.

Inheritance is a method of organizing your classes into hierarchies, where more specific types extend less specific types. For a simple example

```javascript
class Rectangle {
	constructor(width, height){
     	this.width = width
        this.height = height
	}
	
	area(){
        return this.width * this.height
	}
}

class Square extends Rectangle {
    constructor(sideLength){
        super(sideLength, sideLength)
    }
}
```

Above we have two classes- a square is a "subtype" of rectangle, which is to say that all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares, and therefore the `Square` **extends** `Rectangle`. The rectangle takes two arguments when it is constructed, the width and height of the rectangle. A square only needs one argument, because by definition it's height and length will be the same. It passes it's side length as both the height and the width to the constructor of it's parent (Rectangle) when it calls `super`. It's a little confusing; here is a diagram to illustrate:



In our case, we would want to create a GameObject class, with a constructor which accepts arguments from the Character constructor to create an image, position it, and place it on the page.

The character class would have a constructor which calls it's parents constructor with super, as well as `setInterval` for movement, and our other methods for walking and stopping, because the logic is specific to characters. You can review the finished code below.
