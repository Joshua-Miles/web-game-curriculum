# Event Based Programming

In the last lesson, we were able to detect the collisions of any two objects in our game. However, we have not implemented a *response* to the collisions yet.

What do you think our object should do when they collide? With a little bit of thinking we can imagine that when the main "moveable" character collides with a wall, they stop moving, when they collide with an enemy, they would lose health, when they collide with a bank of fog, nothing of consequence would happen. In other words, the response of an object to a collision would be *dependent on what collided with what*. So the logic for responding to a collision will need to be in our abstracted classes, like moveable character. How are we going to run code in the `MoveableCharacter` class when a condition is detected way down in the `GameObject` class? We are going to propagate the collision as an **event**.

* Lifecycle Methods

## Lesson

You have actually worked with some events already. When we use `addEventListener` to run code when a keyboard key is pressed, that function waiting to run is called an **event listener**. `keydown` is the **event** it is listening for, and `e`, the event object, is the **payload** of the event. The DOM and browser have a built in event engine for us to wait for user input.

Now, however, we want the ability to both listen for and **emit**, or invoke, events of our own, separate from the DOM. So our first step will be to build an **`EventEmitter`**. 

### Building an EventEmitter

In it's simplest form, an `EventEmitter` is a type of object with two methods:

> **`.on(event, callback)`**

This method is similar to the `.addEventListener` method. It's purpose is to schedule code, in the form of a callback function, to run at one or more specific points in time, specifically when the specified event is emitted.

> **`.emit(event, payload)`**

This method is called to announce that the `event` has occurred. Any `callback`'s attached to that `event` with `.on` will be invoked, and passed the `payload` as a single argument.

So where do we start? 

If you answered that, because an `EventEmitter` is defined as a *type of object*, we should start by defining a class, then you are correct (put this code in a new file named `EventEmitter.js`, and be sure to include it in `index.html`):

```javascript
//
class EventEmitter {
    
}
```

Let's add the methods we defined:

```javascript
class EventEmitter {
    
    on(event, callback){
        
    }
    
    emit(event, payload){
        
    }
    
}
```

Now we need a place to store our callbacks. We can potentially have many; since number of callbacks we have is *unenumerated*, the best data structure to use would be an `Array`:

```javascript
class EventEmitter {
    
	constructor(){
        this.listeners = []
	}    
    
    on(event, callback){
        
    }
    
    emit(event, payload){
        
    }
    
}
```

We know we need to add both the event and the callback passed to `.on` to instance property `listeners`, grouped together so that we can find the listener by the event later in the the `.emit` method. This is a good use case for a **POJO**- a Plain Old JavaScript Object\

```javascript
...

.on(event, callback){
    let listener = {
		event: event,
		callback: callback
	}
	this.listeners.push(listener)
} 
```

We could get rid of the middleman-variable if we wanted to:

```javascript
...

on(event, callback){
	this.listeners.push({
		event: event,
		callback: callback
	})
} 
...
```

Now we need to look up that event in emit. Time to use `forEach` again:

```javascript
...
emit(event, payload){
    this.listeners.forEach( listener => {
        // We can deal with each listener individually
    })
}
...
```

Then we can check if the listener we are iterating over is listening for the event that was emitted:

```javascript
...
emit(event, payload){
    this.listeners.forEach( listener => {
        if(listener.event == event){
            
        }
    })
}
...
```

And finally, invoke the listener's callback with the payload:

```javascript
...
emit(event, payload){
    this.listeners.forEach( listener => {
        if(listener.event == event){
            listener.callback(payload)
        }
    })
}
...
```

Now to test it. Open your project and console, then create a new instance of an event emitter:

```javascript
let events =  new EventEmitter
```

Let's listen for an arbitrary event:

```javascript
events.on('my super arbitrary event', payload => {
    console.log('This super arbitrary payload: ', payload)
})
```

Finally, let's emit the event:

```javascript
events.emit('my super arbitrary event', 'is a string')
```

If all went according to plan you should have seen `This super arbitrary payload: is a string` in your console.



### Using an EventEmitter

`EventEmitter`'s tend to work well as parent classes. We want our game objects to be able to listen for and respond to events, so we will make the `GameObject` inherit from `EventEmitter`:

```javascript
// GameObject.js

let gameObjects = []

class GameObject  extends EventEmitter {

    constructor(x, y){
        super()
...
```

Now that `GameObject` has a parent class, it will need to call super at the top of it's constructor. 

At the bottom of our `GameObject` file, let's emit a `collision` event when two object collide, and send the object that was collided with as the payload:

```javascript
// GameObject.js
...

setInterval( () => {
    gameObjects.forEach( one => {
        gameObjects.forEach( two => {
            if(one === two) return
            if(
                one.leftSide < two.rightSide 
                    &&
                one.rightSide > two.leftSide
                    &&
                one.top > two.bottom
                    &&
                one.bottom < two.top
            ){
                one.emit('collision', two)
            }
        })
    })
}, 1)
```

Finally, let's listen for this collision in the `MoveableCharacter` class, and stop the character when he collides with another character:

```javascript
// MoveableCharacter.js

class MoveableCharacter extends Character {

    constructor(x, y, color){
        super(x, y, color)

        this.on('collision', object => {
            if(object instanceof Character){
                this.stop()
            }
        })
```

`instanceof` is a useful little operator which does what it sounds like; evaluates to true when what's to the left of it is an instance of the class to the right of it.

If you refresh your browser, and move the character to collide with our other character, you should be stopped as soon as you collide... ish. Our system doesn't really account for the whole "equal and opposite reaction" thing. Let's make the character bounce backwards in response the collision, using the dynamic properties we defined in the last lesson:

```javascript
// MoveableCharacter.js
...
this.on('collision', object => {
    if(object instanceof Character){
        switch(this.direction){
            case 'right':
                this.x -= 5
            break; 
            case 'left':
                this.x += 5
            break; 
            case 'up':
                this.y -= 5
            break; 
            case 'down':
                this.y += 5
            break; 
        }
    	this.stop()
    }
})
```

Yay! Decent collision handling at last. But the code is- a little messy still. That's a lot of logic we wrote inside the constructor of the `MoveableCharacter`.  We can move that logic out of the constructor by implementing an alternate event listener syntax that expressed itself as a method instead of a simple callback- **lifecycle methods**.

### Lifecycle Methods

Lifecycle methods are closely related to event based programming. They are methods of a class which are called automatically in response to events, and they would allow us to refactor our `MoveableCharacter` class to look like this:

```javascript
// MoveableCharacter.js

class MoveableCharacter extends Character {
    
    constructor(){
        ...
    }
    
     onCollision(object){
        if(object instanceof Character){
            switch(this.direction){
                case 'right':
                    this.x -= 5
                break; 
                case 'left':
                    this.x += 5
                break; 
                case 'up':
                    this.y -= 5
                break; 
                case 'down':
                    this.y += 5
                break; 
            }
            this.stop()
        }
    }
}
```

Here, the name of the method reveals that it  is an event listener with the *on* prefix, and specifies the name of the event it is listening for.

For our `EventEmitter` to support this syntax, we need to update the `emit` method. First we need to capitalize the event name. Refer to Mozilla's documentation on `String`  methods if you would like to learn more about `charAt`, `toUpperCase`, or `substr`: 

```javascript
// EventEmitter.js
...

emit(event, payload){
        let capitalizedEvent = event.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + event.substr(1)
...
```

Next, let's use interpolation to turn the capitalized event into the name of a lifecycle method (add the "on" prefix):

```javascript
// EventEmitter.js
...

emit(event, payload){
        let capitalizedEvent = event.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + event.substr(1)
        let lifecycleMethodName = `on${capitalizedEvent}`
...       
```

Finally, we'll check to see if `this` contains a property for the lifecycle method which is a function, and if it does, we will invoke the method with the payload:

```javascript
// EventEmitter.js
...

emit(event, payload){
        let capitalizedEvent = event.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + event.substr(1)
        let lifecycleMethodName = `on${capitalizedEvent}`
        if(typeof this[lifecycleMethodName] == 'function'){
            this[lifecycleMethodName](payload)
        }
        this.listeners.forEach( listener => {
            if(listener.event == event){
                listener.callback(payload)
            }
        })
    }
```

## Check Your Understanding

* Add a method to the `EventEmitter`, `.nowAndOn(event, callback)`. It should run the callback immediately, and also when every time the event fires.
* Given what you know about `EventEmitter's` and objects, what would you expect the following code to log? Why? After you have clearly defined your answers, test your hypothesis in the console 

 ```javascript
let events1 = new EventEmitter
let events2 = new EventEmitter

events1.on('hello', payload => console.log(payload)) 
events2.emit('hello', 'world')
 ```
