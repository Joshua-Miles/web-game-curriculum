# Dynamic Properties

Today we are going to try and determine when two or more of our `GameObject`s **collide**. This is going to be tricky, so we are going to want to do some refactoring to make working with our `GameObject`s as *simple as possible*. This will require that we learning about **code separation**, **arrays**, **instance properties**, **getters**, and **setters**

As you work through today's lesson, you will see that we are instantiating a second character, and passing an option so that he is a different color;  we are also using a new class (`MoveableCharacter`) for the games user-controlled character- if you completed the *Check Your Understanding* portion of the last lecture, you should have similar code and two characters instantiated in your `index.js` file. We recommend that you keep whatever code you wrote for that exercise, rather than try and copy the code you see here. Moving forward, it will be more beneficial for you to try and apply the concepts of the lessons to your own project, which will look a little different, than for you to simply copy code. If you get stuck because the example code in the lesson and your personal project are different, reach out to your guide for assistance.  

## Outline

* Code Separation
* Arrays
* Review of Instance Properties
* Introduction to Getters and Setters

## Lesson

### Code Separation

To start, lets split the code into separate files. Create another file in your working directory named `index.js`, and move the contents of your `<script>` tag into that file. In a browser, JavaScript can be included into an html file via `src` attributes on one or more `<script>` tags, each of which would reference the location of the script you want to include. Add an `src` attribute to your now empty script tag in index.html:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<html>
    <body>
        <script src="./index.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

If you refresh the page, it should continue to work just the same as before. Now let's add several more files and script tags to our project:

* GameObject.js:

```javascript
// GameObject.js

class GameObject {

    constructor(x, y){
        this.element = document.createElement('img')
        this.element.style.position = 'absolute'
        this.element.style.left = x
        this.element.style.bottom = y
        this.element.style.height = '145px'
        this.element.style.width = '100px'
        
        document.body.append(this.element)
    }

}
```

* Character.js:

```javascript
// Character.js

class Character extends GameObject {

    constructor(x, y){
        super(x, y, color)
		this.assets = 'https://joshua-miles.github.io/web-game-curriculum/module-1/assets/${color}'
        this.element.src = `${this.assets}/static.gif`
        this.direction = false
        setInterval( () => {
            switch(this.direction){
                case 'right':
                    this.element.style.left = parseInt(this.element.style.left) + 1 + 'px'
                break;
                case 'left':
                    this.element.style.left = parseInt(this.element.style.left) - 1 + 'px'
                break;
                case 'up':
                    this.element.style.bottom = parseInt(this.element.style.bottom) + 1 + 'px'
                break;
                case 'down':
                    this.element.style.bottom = parseInt(this.element.style.bottom) - 1 + 'px'
                break;
            }
        }, 1)       
    }
    
    walkRight(){
        this.element.src = `${this.assets}/walkright.gif`
        this.direction = 'right'
    }

    walkLeft(){
        this.element.src = `${this.assets}/walkleft.gif`
        this.direction = 'left'
    }

    walkUp(){
        this.element.src = `${this.assets}/walkup.gif`
        this.direction = 'up'
    }

    walkDown(){
        this.element.src = `${this.assets}/walkdown.gif`
        this.direction = 'down'
    }


    stop(){
        this.element.src = `${this.assets}/static.gif`
        this.direction = false
    }
}
```

* MoveableCharacter.js

```javascript
// MoveableCharacter.js
class MoveableCharacter extends Character {

    constructor(x, y, color){
        super(x, y, color)
        
        document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
            if(this.direction) return
            switch(e.key){
                case 'ArrowRight':
                    this.walkRight()
                break;
                case 'ArrowLeft':
                    this.walkLeft()
                break;
                case 'ArrowUp':
                    this.walkUp()
                break;
                case 'ArrowDown':
                    this.walkDown()
                break;
            }
        })
        
        document.addEventListener('keyup', () => {
            this.stop()
        })
    }

}
```



* index.js

```javascript
// index.js

let green = new MoveableCharacter('0px', '0px', 'green-character')
let red = new Character('200px', '200px', 'red-character')
```

* index.html

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<html>
    <body>
        <script src="./GameObject.js"></script>
        <script src="./Character.js"></script>
        <script src="./MoveableCharacter.js"></script>
        <script src="./index.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

Notice the order of the script tags, because the order is important. The browser will run each of these scripts, in the order they are listed in our html page. Because `index.js` references the `MoveableCharacter` class defined in `MoveableCharacter.js`, the `MoveableCharacter.js` script must come before the `index.js` script tag, otherwise `MoveableCharacter` would be undefined when we tried to instantiate it! In the same way, because `MoveableCharacter.js` references the `Character` class, `Character.js` must be included before `MoveableCharacter.js`, and `GameObject.js` must be included before `Character.js`.

Also notice the convention we used to separate our code- `GameObject.js` and `Character.js` are both named after classes they define. If we were to include only those two files, nothing would happen- because they only *define* the classes. No class is actually used (instantiated) until `index.js`. This is an extremely common pattern that you will see in not only JavaScript, but a majority of programming languages and application architectures.

Now that our code is organized into tidy, more manageable files, let's begin to determine when our `character` collides with the `redCharacter`. 

### Arrays

The first decision we need to make is *where* we are going to check for collisions. 
Should we check:

* in the index?
* in the `MoveableCharacter` class?
* in the `Character` class?
* in the `GameObject` class?

How would we go about making this decision? We need to remember that our classes represent *types* of things, and that we should put code where it is most closely related to the *type* of thing the code is interested in- this is much more an artform than a science, and you will get better at it with time. Please note that it is much better to choose a poor place to put code in 5 minutes than a better place to put code in 5 hours, so don't obsess over the decision to much. In this case, we're thinking that, sense we would ideally like to know when *any* two object collide, it makes the most sense to put the collision check in the `GameObject` class.

If the logic is going to be in the `GameObject` class, that class is going to need to keep track of all the GameObjects we create, or, in other words, all of the times that it is instantiated. We don't know how many times a GameObject will be instantiated, so we need a *data structure of variable length*- a list of game objects, if you will. In JavaScript we create lists using a type of object called an **Array**. Arrays are objects that can contain other variables, including objects, strings, and numbers, and allow us to **iterate** over them. Run this in your console to see what we mean:

```javascript
let myNumbers = [ 1, 2, 3 ]
myNumbers.forEach( number => {
    console.log(number)
})
```

The angle brackets tell JavaScript that we are creating an array and, each of the comma-separated elements within the brackets will become **elements** in that array. `forEach` is a method of all `Array`s- the same way that `walkLeft` is a method of all of our `Character`s. `forEach` accepts a callback function, just like `addEventListener` accepts a callback function. The difference is, while `addEventListener` invokes the callback we give it when an event occurs, `forEach` will call the callback we give it immediately- once for every element in the array. As a result, the above code logs three numbers to the console, because the callback runs three times- first with the variable `number` set to 1, then again with the variable `number` set to 2, and finally 3. 

In our `GameObject` class, we will create an array to hold all of our GameObject instances, like so:

```javascript
// GameObject.js

let gameObjects = []

class GameObject {

    constructor(x, y){
        this.element = document.createElement('img')
        this.element.style.position = 'absolute'
        this.element.style.left = x
        this.element.style.bottom = y
        this.element.style.height = '145px'
        this.element.style.width = '100px'
        
        document.body.append(this.element)
        gameObjects.push(this)
    }

}
```

Notice that we create `gameObjects` as an empty Array- then, in the `GameObject` constructor, we use the `push` method to add `this` (which, bear in mind, is an instance of a `GameObject`, because it is inside the `GameObject` class), into the `gameObjects` array. Now if we iterate over the `gameObjects` array in the console, our callback should be invoked twice- once for `character`, and once for `redCharacter`:

```javascript
gameObjects.forEach( gameObject => {
    console.log(gameObject)
})
```

Now we want to compare each `gameObject` to *every other* `gameObject`. This might seem mind boggling, but we can accomplish the task quite simply by nesting *another* `forEach` inside the first:

```javascript
gameObjects.forEach( one => {
	gameObjects.forEach( two => {
        console.log('Comparing', one, 'with', two)
	})
})
```

If all goes according to plan, you will probably see four console logs: 

1. compares `character` with `character`
2. compares `character` with `redCharacter`
3.  compares `redCharacter` with `character`
4. compares `redCharacter` with `redCharacter`

Now, 2 and 3 maybe duplicated, but we will leave that on the side for now. The bigger problem is that, if we started checking for collisions right now, we would be checking whether or not a game object *collides with itself* in cases 1 and 4- which is clearly ridiculous. Let's add a condition to avoid those cases:

```javascript
gameObjects.forEach( one => {
	gameObjects.forEach( two => {
        if(one === two) return
        console.log('Comparing', one, 'with', two)
	})
})
```

Now, we return (or skip) any iterations where `one` and `two` are actually the same object. Now, at last, we can see if game object `one` and game object `two` are colliding.

Collision can be defined as overlap, in which case, all we need to do is check mathematically whether or not the two objects overlap:

```
gameObjects.forEach( one => {
	gameObjects.forEach( two => {
        if(one === two) return
        if(
           one.leftSide < two.rightSide 
           	&&
           one.rightSide > two.leftSide
           	&&
           one.top > two.bottom
           	&&
           one.bottom < two.top
        ){
            console.log(one, 'collided with', two)
        }
	})
})
```

Here, we are checking multiple conditions at the same time using the `&&` (and) operator). If all the conditions are true, then by definition the objects overlap! 

The problem is, we have not defined the **properties** we are trying to reference here- game objects do not have:

* `leftSide`s
* `rightSide`s
* `top`s
* `bottom`s

Let's dig a little deeper into object properties so that we can add the ones we need and check for collisions using the code we have above.

### Review of Instance Properties

Properties are variables "attached" to an object- like the `element` which belongs to each `Character`. We access it as `this.element` inside the class, and `<instance name>.element` outside the class ( `character.element`, for example.) `.assets` is a property of each `Character`, `.direction` is a property of each `Character`, and `.walkLeft` is a property of each `Character`- a property which also happens to be a function. When a property is also a function, we call it a **method**. Because methods are functions, they must be invoked if we want them to run: `character.walkLeft()`. But non-function properties (sometimes called **attributes**) are simply referenced- `character.direction` gives us the current direction of the character. If we wanted to add properties for each side of a character, we could do so in the constructor:

```javascript
// GameObject.js

class GameObject {

    constructor(x, y){
    

        this.element = document.createElement('img')
        this.element.style.position = 'absolute'
        this.element.style.left = x
        this.element.style.bottom = y
        this.element.style.height = '145px'
        this.element.style.width = '100px'
        
        this.leftSide = this.element.style.left
        this.rightSide = this.element.style.left + this.element.style.width
        this.bottom = this.element.style.bottom
        this.top = this.element.style.bottom + this.element.style.height
        
        document.body.append(this.element)
    }

}
```

If you tried to run this in the console, it probably didn't work. Remember how, in our `setInterval` callback, we had to use `parseInt` to turn `left` and `bottom` properties from strings into numbers? The same problem plagues us now. We could fix this  be adding `parseInt`...

```javascript
// GameObject.js

class GameObject {

    constructor(x, y){
    

        this.element = document.createElement('img')
        this.element.style.position = 'absolute'
        this.element.style.left = x
        this.element.style.bottom = y
        this.element.style.height = '145px'
        this.element.style.width = '100px'
        
        this.leftSide = parseInt(this.element.style.left)
        this.rightSide = parseInt(this.element.style.left) + parseInt(this.element.style.width)
        this.bottom = parseInt(this.element.style.bottom)
        this.top = parseInt(this.element.style.bottom) + parseInt(this.element.style.height)
        
        document.body.append(this.element)
    }

}
```

... but- ewww. This is super repetitive, much harder to read, and worst of all, because this logic *only runs once* when the object is first created, we would have to update these values *everywhere* we change an objects element's styles. That would be so. Incredibly. Annoying.

Instead, what if we defined these properties *as methods*:

```javascript
// GameObject.js

let gameObjects = []

class GameObject {

    constructor(x, y){
        this.element = document.createElement('img')
        this.element.style.position = 'absolute'
        this.element.style.left = x
        this.element.style.bottom = y
        this.element.style.width = '100px'
        this.element.style.height = '145px'
        document.body.append(this.element)
        gameObjects.push(this)
    }
    
    leftSide(){
        return parseInt(this.element.style.left)
    }
    
    rightSide(){
       	return this.leftSide() + parseInt(this.element.style.width)
    }
    
    bottom(){
        return parseInt(this.element.style.bottom)
    }
    
    top(){
      	return this.bottom() + parseInt(this.element.style.height)   
    }

}
```

This is better! We can reuse more of our code, and by evaluating this *when we reference* the property instead of inside the constructor, we know that the values we get back will always be current. But there are still a few problems. For one thing, we can't use this to set these values (e.g., `this.leftSide() = 5` won't work). For another, we try to use methods to define *behavior*- `walkLeft` is a method because it *changes the `Character`'s state of being*. Referencing the `leftSide` in and of itself should not, ideally, constitute behavior. And it is in these circumstances, where would like to define the value of a property when it is accessed, but do not want the property to constitute behavior, that **getters** and **setters** become very, very helpful tools.

### Getters and Setters

**getters** and **setters** are means of defining dynamic properties using getter and setter functions, as opposed to defining properties whose values are themselves functions which still need to be invoked- that sounded super confusing, but stick with me here.

Imagine we have a class which represents a user:

```javascript
class User {
    constructor(firstName, lastName){
        this.firstName = firstName
        this.lastName = lastName
    }
    
    fullName(){
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
    }
}

let user = new User('John', 'Doe')
```

We define the user as having a `firstName` attribute, a `lastName` attribute, and a method `fullName` which returns the concatenated `firstName` and `lastName`. If we change the first or last name, then the `fullName` method will return an updated version of the full name, because it *references* the other, now updated variables.

If we were to do some checking:

```javascript
user.firstName // => "John"
user.lastName  // => "Doe"
user.fullName  // => "function fullName(){...}"
```

`firstName` and `lastName` are strings, as we would want and expect, but `fullName` is a function. If we want a string, we have to invoke that function:

```javascript
user.firstName // => "John"
user.lastName  // => "Doe"
user.fullName()  // => "John Doe"
```

This manner of referencing is inconsistent, and denotes behavior instead of simple aggregation.

Let's redefine our User class using a **getter**:

```javascript
class User {
    constructor(firstName, lastName){
        this.firstName = firstName
        this.lastName = lastName
    }
    
    get fullName(){
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
    }
}

let user = new User('John', 'Doe')
```

If you skimmed that quickly it might look the exact same to you. All we did was put the word `get` in front of `fullName`. Now if we check the properties

```javascript
user.firstName // => "John"
user.lastName  // => "Doe"
user.fullName  // => "John Doe"
```

We no longer have to invoke the method- it is invoked automatically when referenced!

We can create **setters** this way as well, a setter method will receive one argument, the value we are trying to set (don't worry too much about what our setter method is doing for now):

```javascript
class User {
    constructor(firstName, lastName){
        this.firstName = firstName
        this.lastName = lastName
    }
    
    get fullName(){
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
    }
    set fullName(value){
    	let split = value.split(' ')
    	this.firstName = split[0]
    	this.lastName = split[1]
	}
}

let user = new User('John', 'Doe')
user.firstName // => "John"
user.fullName = "Jane Doe"
user.firstName // => "Jane"
```

Let's use getters and setters to further improve our `GameObject`:

```javascript
// GameObject.js

let gameObjects = []

class GameObject {

    constructor(x, y){
        this.element = document.createElement('img')
        this.element.style.position = 'absolute'
        this.x = x
        this.y = y
        this.width = 100
        
        document.body.append(this.element)
        gameObjects.push(this)
    }
    
    get x(){
        return parseInt(this.element.style.left)
    }
    
    set x(value){
        this.element.style.left = `${value}px`
    }
    
    get y(){
        return parseInt(this.element.style.bottom)
    }
    
    set y(value){
        this.element.style.bottom = `${value}px`
    }
    
    get width(){
        return parseInt(this.element.style.width)
    }
    
    set width(value){
         this.element.style.width = `${value}px`
    }
    
    get height(){
         return parseInt(this.element.style.height)
    }
    
    set height(value){
        this.element.style.height = `${value}px`
    }
    
    get leftSide(){
        return this.x
    }
    
    get rightSide(){
       	return this.leftSide + this.width
    }
    
    get bottom(){
        return this.y
    }
	
	get top(){
        return this.y + this.height
	}

}
```

Let's change our index, so that we pass in numbers instead of strings for x and y positioning:

```javascript
// index.js

let green = new MoveableCharacter(0, 0, 'green-character')
let red = new Character(200, 200, 'red-character')
```

Finally, move your collision detection logic into a `setInterval` at the end of the `GameObjec.js` constructor.

Refresh the page, and, if all went well, the collision should be logged as soon as you run into the `redCharacter`.

Yay! Except that, even though the collision is logging, our characters still pass through one another like temporal spirits. Hm. In the next lesson, we will use Event Driven programming, so that we not only detect collisions, but also *respond* to them.

## Check Your Understanding

* When demonstrating a setter method, we used an array method `.split`. Using this documentation, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split, try to understand or explain how the `set fullName` method works.

* Our `leftSide`, `rightSide`, `top`, and `bottom` properties do not have setter methods. What happens when you try to set one of these properties in the console like so: `character.leftSide = 5`?

* Should these properties have setter methods? Why or why not? If they should, how would each method work?

* We added some nifty getters and setters to our GameObject today- let's use them to refactor our `walk<Direction>` methods a little more readable
