# Functional Programming

## Outline

* Use functions to organize our code
* Use functions as callbacks to move our character image every millisecond
* Use functions and variables to determine *when* the character should move
* Use functions as event listeners to move the character when a user presses an arrow key

## Lesson

In this lesson, we will use the rendering techniques we learned yesterday to make the image of our character moveable, primarily using JavaScript. To start, we're going to learn a little bit more about JavaScript as a programming language.

The objective of any programming language is to instruct the computer on how to do something, how to behave in a manner that we want it to. There are many different ways to organize our instructions to a computer, just as there are many ways to instruct a person to complete a series of tasks:

* You could organize the tasks into other, more general tasks, and reference them later:

  > To create a character, you would create an image of a character, then make it 100 pixels wide, move it 200 pixels from the left side of the screen.
  >
  > To make a character removeable, you would listen for when that character is clicked, and when it is, remove it from the page.
  >
  > Now, I want you to **create a character** and **make it removeable**.

  This is called **functional** programming. We organize our code into functions, and then reference them later. We'll see how the exact code looks in a minute.

* Alternatively, you could organize the tasks as they relate to specific, tangible "things". 

  > Imagine a small character, with a green outfit, 100 pixels wide and 200 pixels from the left side of the screen. When it is clicked, remove it from the page.

  This is called "Object Oriented Programming". The character itself would, in this case, be one such "thing", and we would group all of the code we write about that character inside this "object". That would be extremely useful, and we will learn how to do it in the next lesson.

These approaches, while not mutually exclusive, they are considered different **programming paradigms**, a term which here means different ways of thinking about programming. JavaScript is an odd duck when compared to other programming languages. Legend has it that, when it was being developed by Netscape many years ago, it was originally conceived as a primarily functional programming language, only later to  be made somewhat object oriented due to the timely success of the languages namesake, Java.

As we develop our game, we will start by organizing our code into functions, then re-organize it into objects as appropriate.

Open your dev tools (right click > inspect), then select the "console" tab.

In your console, write the following: (use SHIFT + Enter to move to the next line)

```javascript
let onePlus = function(number){
    return 1 + number
}
```



`let onePlus` should be familiar to us- we use `let` to give names to, or rather **assign** names to variables. Here we are setting the name `onePlus` to  a **function**- a block of re-useable code. This is called **defining** a function. Defining a function can be split into the following parts:

* The `function` keyword tells the computer that we are defining a function.

* The parenthesis is used to receive variables into the function- we can receive as many variables as we like (separated by commas) when we define a function, and we can name those variables anything we like. In this example, we receive one variable and name it "number".

* The curly braces denote the function  body- everything between them is considered part of the function. 

* `return` is used define the output of the function. The function we have defined returns the sum of 1 and the number that was passed in.

Press enter, and the function will be evaluated by your browser. Now, if you type `onePlus` and press enter, the console should display the function you wrote. This is called **referencing** the function. Now type `onePlus(5)` and press enter. This time, the console should display "6". Because of the parenthesis, we are no longer referencing but rather **invoking**, actually running, the function. Our function accepted "5" as "number" inside the function, which ran like so: 

```javascript
let onePlus = function(number){ // number = 5
    return 1 + number // = 1 + 5
}
```

Now type `onePlus(4) + onePlus(9)`. The console should display 15:

* `onePlus(4) // = 5`
* `onePlus(9) // = 10 `
* `onePlus(4) + onePlus(9) // = 5 + 10 = 15` 

Neat! Let's use what we've learned about functions to re-write our character JavaScript:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<html>
    <body>
        <script>
            
            let createCharacter = function(){
				let characterElement = document.createElement('img')
                let assets = 'https://joshua-miles.github.io/web-game-curriculum/module-1/assets/green-character'
                characterElement.src = `${assets}/static.gif`
                characterElement.style.position = 'absolute'
                characterElement.style.left = '200px'
                characterElement.style.width = '75px'
                document.body.append(characterElement)
                return characterElement
            }

            let makeCharacterRemoveable = function(character){
                 character.addEventListener('click', function(){
                    character.remove()
                })
            }
                
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

This follows the first two points of the process we outlined in plain English at the beginning our lecture: 

> To create a character, you would create an image of a character, then make it 100 pixels wide, move it 200 pixels from the left side of the screen.
>
> To make a character removeable, you would listen for when that character is clicked, and when it is, remove it from the page.
>
> Now, I want you to **create a character** and **make it removeable**.

If you refresh the browser... Nothing will happen. That is because we have **define**d but not **invoked**, or actually run, any functions. We have told the computer how to create a character, and how to make a character removeable, but we haven't told the computer to *actually do* either of those things.

Add the following to your script:

```javascript
let myCharacter = createCharacter() // = <img></img>
makeCharacterRemoveable(myCharacter)
```

Refresh the browser. The code should work as it did before. Yay!

To better understand our "makeCharacterRemoveable" function, we need to learn about one of JavaScripts features as a functional programming language: **callbacks**. Do you see how we're using the `function` keyword again *inside* our "makeCharacterRemoveable" function? Let's reorganize "makeCharacterRemoveable" to dissect what's going on here: 

```javascript
let makeCharacterRemoveable = function(character){
    
    let removeCharacter = function(){
        character.remove()
    }
    
    character.addEventListener('click', removeCharacter)
}
```

Now we can see more clearly that we are defining a function which actually removes the character image from the page. This time we are giving the function the name "removeCharacter". Then we are *invoking* another function- "character.addEventListener". We are passing it two **arguments**, a word which here means variables we are giving as input to the function. The first argument is the event we are listening for (in this case, the "click" event), the second... what type of variable is removeCharacter? It is a function! We defined removeCharacter as a function just above this in our code, and now we are *referencing* that function as we pass it into "character.addEventListener".  This tells the computer to *invoke* (actually run) the removeCharacter function when the character image is clicked. Defining the removeCharacter function inline, like so:

```javascript
 let makeCharacterRemoveable = function(character){
     character.addEventListener('click', function(){
     	character.remove()
     })
 }
```

does the exact same thing, we are just passing the function into character.addEventListener directly, instead of referencing it by a name. Because removeCharacter no longer has a name in this example, we would call it an **anonymous** function. 

Let's apply what we've learned about functions and callbacks to leverage another built-in function: `setInterval`. `setInterval` accepts a callback function as it's first argument, and a number of milliseconds to wait between invoking that function as it's second argument: `setInterval(callback, milliseconds)`. 

Let's test the function: 

```javascript
setInterval(function(){
	console.log('Here we go again!')
}, 1000)
```

If you run this in your console, you should see "Here we go again!" once every second. We can use this function to give the allusion of our character moving, by adding the following to the end of our script:

```javascript
setInterval(function(){
	console.log(myCharacter.style.left + 1)
}, 1)
```

Refresh your browser and watch what happens in your console- we would expect that myCharacter.style.left, which is 200px, plus 1 would be 201px. But that's not what we see. Because myCharacter.style.left is a string, JavaScript simply converts the number to a string and concatenates them to "200px1", which is not what we want at all! We need to turn the string "200px" into the number 200. We can use the function `parseInt` to turn a string into an integer a word which here  means a number with no decimal places: 

```javascript
setInterval(function(){
	console.log(parseInt(myCharacter.style.left) + 1)
}, 1)
```

Yay! Now it logs 205! Let's add 'px', and reassign  the value of myCharacter.style.left:

```javascript
setInterval(function(){
	myCharacter.style.left = parseInt(myCharacter.style.left) + 1 + 'px'
}, 1)
```

Awesome! The character floats to the left without moving his feet like some kind of spirit. We'll fix that in a bit. First we want to be able to decide when the character walks, and when it stops. 

At the top of our script, let's create an actual variable- a name whose value we will later change- and call it `walkingRight`:

```javascript
let walkingRight = false;
```

We are setting it to `false` - unlike most of the values we have assigned thus far, this is not a string, but rather a boolean. We can use it to check whether or not the character should actually be walking left. Replace the `setInterval` portion of your code with this:

```javascript
setInterval(function(){
   if(walkingRight == true){
       myCharacter.style.left = parseInt(myCharacter.style.left) + 1 + 'px'
   } 
}, 1)
```

The **if** statement will check if the variable `walkingRight` is true- we use two equal signs, because using one equal sign (`walkingRight = true`) would *assign* `walkingRight` the value of true, instead of checking if it's value *is already* true. 

Refresh your browser. The character should be standing still. Now, change the value of `walkingRight` in your console: `walkingRight = true`. The character should begin moving left. Set `walkingRight = false` and it should stop again. Awesome!

Let's create some functions which change this variable for us, and add them to our script: 

```javascript
let walkRight = function(){
    walkingRight = true
}

let stop = function(){
    walkingRight = false
}
```

Refresh the browser and invoke these functions from the console. Remember that we must use parenthesis at the end of a function's name to invoke it: `walkRight()`. Stop the character by invoking `stop()`. 

You may be wondering why we would create these functions, if all they do is change the variable- the end result is the same as changing the variable walkingLeft directly. But here is what's fun about changing the value of that variable in a function: we can also change the "src" attribute of the image, to make it look like he's really walking:

```javascript
let walkRight = function(){
    myCharacter.src = `${assets}/walkright.gif`
    walkingRight = true
}

let stop = function(){
    myCharacter.src = `${assets}/static.gif`
    walkingRight = false
}
```

Now we need to use an event listener- like the one we used to remove a character's image earlier- to listen for when a user presses the arrow keys:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e){
    if(e.key == 'ArrowRight'){
        walkRight()
    }
})

document.addEventListener('keyup', function(){
    stop()
})
```

So what is this new mysterious `e` variable? It is an argument which the *browser* passes our event listener functions when it invokes them. It contains valuable information about a particular event such as which key was pressed for a `keydown` event.

If you run your code now you should be able to move the character right using the arrow keys- but he is probably suturing a bit, or stops moving his feet after a second. Hmmmm.

Let's put a console.log *inside* our event listener, so we can see when it is invoked: 

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e){
	console.log('key down', e)
    if(e.key == 'ArrowRight'){
        walkRight()
    }
})
```

When you replace the first  keydown event listener with the code above, and refresh the browser, you should see in your console that the "key down" event fires repeatedly as you hold down the key- this is causing our character to start walking right continuously, restarting his animation and making him appear as if he is sliding on ice!

Let's skip repeat events:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e){
	if(walkingRight) return
    if(e.key == 'ArrowRight'){
        walkRight()
    }
})
```

And now the `return` statement will stop the character from walking right if the character is already walking right, and our animation plays nicely.

We're done with the `makeCharacterRemoveable` function, so let's get rid of it.

The completed code is below, including code to move the character in directions other than right- but I would strongly recommend that you to try to implement the other directions on your own for more practice.

## Check Your Understanding

* We learned about `if` statements in this lesson, but there are other ways to conditionally run code. Read a little about switch statements here: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_switch.asp, then try to simplify (also called refactoring in the coding world) you code, replacing your `if`'s with `switch`es. 
* We saw how JavaScript behaved oddly when we tried to add a string to a number earlier in this lesson. This is one of many JavaScript quirks that can arise from "coalescing", the process by which JavaScript tries to change a variables data type for you. Read about some other crazy JS quirks in this blog article by a Flatiron School student: https://medium.com/@clairenguyen/javascript-quirks-a5cffbb49a0e
