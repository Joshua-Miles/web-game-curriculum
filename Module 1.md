# Module 1: The Basics

- Lesson I

  - Concept: The Basics of Rendering
  - Tools: 
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - The DOM
    - Event Listeners
  - Application: A scene with an object which disappears when you click it

- Lesson II

  - Concept: Functional Programming
  - Tools:
    - Functions
    - Callbacks
    - setInterval
  - Application: A moveable character

- Lesson III: 

  - Concept: Abstraction by Inheritance
  - Tools:
    - Objects
    - Classes
  - Application: Multiple characters which extend a reusable base "game object" class

- Lesson IV:

  - Concept: Meta Programming with Custom Object Properties
  - Tools:
    - Arrays
    - Getters / Setters
  - Application: Collision Detection

- Lesson V: 

  - Concept: Event Based Programming
  - Tools:
    - Dictionary Objects (Variable Property Keys)
  - Application: Collision Propagation 

- Projects:

  - Use the tools and abstractions we've created thus far to build a system with no less than 3 game-object-types and a playable character, each of which behave distinctly when they collide
  - Use what we've learned to build another visual element that is **not** a game object- it should be created using a class representing something which exists outside of the world of the game, such as a health bar, a wallet, or an inventory. It should provide methods or custom object properties to be used by game objects to update the display of the visual element accordingly. In future projects, we will refer to this non-game-object-visual-element as the **HUD** (heads up display).
